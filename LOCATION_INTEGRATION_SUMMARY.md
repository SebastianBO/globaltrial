# Location-Based Filtering and Map Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated location-based filtering and map functionality into the GlobalTrials search page.

## Features Added

### 1. Location-Based Filtering
- **Distance filtering**: Users can filter trials within specific radius (10km, 25km, 50km, 100km, 250km, 500km)
- **Location text search**: Existing city/state/country text filtering
- **Automatic user location detection**: Uses browser geolocation API
- **Distance calculations**: Shows distance to nearest trial location for each trial

### 2. Map View Integration
- **Interactive Google Maps**: Shows trial locations with custom markers
- **Toggle between List/Map views**: Seamless switching between view modes
- **Location markers**: Green for recruiting trials, gray for non-recruiting
- **Info windows**: Click markers to see facility details and distance
- **Trial selection**: Click map locations to see trial details below map
- **Fallback display**: Shows location list when Google Maps API key not configured

### 3. Enhanced Search Experience
- **"Nearest First" sorting**: Sort trials by distance when user location available
- **Distance display**: Shows distance to closest location on trial cards
- **Location status indicators**: Visual status indicators on map and lists
- **Map controls**: Zoom, center on user, fit all locations, fullscreen mode

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `/app/search/page.tsx` - Main search page with location filtering and map integration
2. `/app/api/search-trials/route.ts` - Updated API to handle location filters
3. `/components/trial-map.tsx` - Existing map component (already implemented)
4. `/lib/location-services.ts` - Existing location utilities (already implemented)

### Dependencies Added
- `@googlemaps/js-api-loader`: Google Maps JavaScript API loader
- `@types/google.maps`: TypeScript definitions for Google Maps

### Key Features
- **Geocoding**: Automatic coordinate lookup for trial locations using OpenStreetMap Nominatim API
- **Caching**: Database caching of geocoded coordinates to avoid repeated API calls
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks when location services unavailable

## Environment Setup Required
Add Google Maps API key to environment variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Note: The map will show a fallback list view if the API key is not configured.

## User Experience Flow
1. User visits search page
2. Browser requests location permission
3. If granted, location-based filters become available
4. User can toggle between List and Map views
5. In Map view, clicking locations shows trial details
6. Distance information enhances decision-making

## Technical Highlights
- **Efficient geocoding**: Only geocodes unique locations, caches results
- **Client-side distance filtering**: Avoids complex database queries
- **Progressive enhancement**: Works without location permission
- **TypeScript safety**: Proper typing throughout the implementation
- **Performance optimized**: Debounced search, efficient map rendering

## Testing Notes
- Location permission testing requires HTTPS or localhost
- Map functionality requires valid Google Maps API key
- Fallback UI tested without API key
- Distance calculations verified with known coordinates

## Future Enhancements
- Batch geocoding for better performance
- Saved location preferences
- Driving directions integration
- Public transport information
- Real-time traffic considerations
